## nox cat recovery

compact view of the JSON recovery API

### Synopsis

The recovery command is a view of index shard recoveries, both on-going and previously completed.
A recovery event occurs anytime an index shard moves to a different node in the cluster.
This can happen during a snapshot recovery, a change in replication level, node failure, or on node startup.
This last type is called a local store recovery and is the normal way for shards to be loaded from disk when a node starts up.
