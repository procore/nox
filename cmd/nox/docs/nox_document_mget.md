## nox document mget

Get multiple documents

### Synopsis

Multi GET API allows to get multiple
documents based on an index, type (optional) and
id (and possibly routing). The response includes a docs
array with all the fetched documents in order corresponding to the original
multi-get request (if there was a failure for a specific get,
an object containing this error is included in place in the response instead).
The structure of a successful get is similar in structure to a document provided by the get API.

```
nox document mget [index] [flags]
